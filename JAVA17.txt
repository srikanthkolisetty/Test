Record class:

	To reduce the boilerplate code.

By writing record class it internally writes the equals,hashcode and toString method and 
as well as private final fields and public constructors (Compiler includes all these)

To create a record class we use a keyword called record.

We can also have static fields, static methods and also custom constructors, custom methods.

Record class cannot extend anyother class.

Sealed classes and interfaces
===================

When we want our class to be inherited by only certain classes then one can make use of this feature.

A class that extends  a sealed class must be either non sealed class or sealed class or a final class.

An interface that extends a sealed interface must be either a sealed interface or a non sealed interface.

Premits is the keyword which is used to permit the inheritance of sealed class to certain other classes.

A sealed class can also extend any other class. 

A sealed class must have a sub class


non-sealed class B extends SealedExample
{

}


public sealed class SealedExample extends Thread implements Cloneable permits B {
}
