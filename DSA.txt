Rate of change is called as time complexity 


Two rules to keep in mind while deciding the time complexity

	1. avoid constants
	2.consider the worst case

Time complexity is the number of operations needed to run an algorithm on large amounts of data.
space complexity = auxiliary space + input space

and the input space is ignored from the above so totally space complexity = auxiliary space

auxiliary space is the amount of space that code uses (excluding input variables)
